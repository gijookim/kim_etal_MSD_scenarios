## Abstract
Human well-being outcomes, such as metrics for food, energy, and water security, are key criteria in assessments of complex human-Earth system interactions but are often overlooked in global change scenarios. Here, we generate a scenario ensemble centered around food, energy, and water security outcomes using a global-scale multisector model that simulates critical interactions across multiple sectors. We consider a wide range of future uncertainties in both physical and societal factors, including socioeconomics, emissions scenarios, land conservation, and temperature impacts on water and energy. We evaluate each scenario by computing both regional and subregional outcomes and identify the uncertainties and key drivers that lead to the outcomes of interest. We find that lower-income subgroups face higher burdens and more uncertain outcomes, and that drivers of well-being outcomes are heterogeneous across regions. Ultimately, our approach can help identify scenarios that can facilitate high-priority research on human well-being outcomes, especially in multisector contexts.
